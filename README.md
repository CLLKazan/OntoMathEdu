OntoMathEdu: a Linguistically Grounded Educational Mathematical Ontology
===============================

OntoMathEdu is a new educational mathematical ontology.

The ontology is intended to be used as:
1. a Linked Open Data hub for mathematical education,
2. a linguistic resource for intelligent mathematical language processing,
3. and an end-user reference educational database.

OntoMathEdu ontology is organized in three layers:

1. The domain ontology layer, which contains language-independent math concepts from the secondary school mathematics curriculum.
2. The linguistic layer, containing multilingual lexicons, that provide linguistic grounding of the concepts from the domain ontology layer.
3. The foundation ontology layer, which provides the concepts with meta-ontological annotations defined by the UFO foundation ontology.

The concepts are organized in two main hierarchies: the hierarchy of objects and the hierarchy of reified relationships.

This repository contains the first release of the ontology, which consists in the linguistic layer, covering plane geometry domain.

The ontology is expressed in the [OWL 2 Manchester Notation](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/), and can be edited by any OWL-compitable ontology editor, such as [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
